## About

Movie Posters is a responsive and user-friendly website for discovering and downloading movie posters.

The purpose of making this website is for me to practice [React](https://reactjs.org) and to serve it as my [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) final project.
